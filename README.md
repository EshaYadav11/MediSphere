Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1 Project Abstract
The Terraguide is a comprehensive web-based solution designed to streamline and optimize operations related to gardeners, dwellers, and administrators. The system simplifies tasks such as profile management, appointment booking, and office administration. Dwellers can search for gardeners and book appointments seamlessly, while gardeners can manage appointment requests efficiently. Administrators have the ability to manage gardeners' requests and oversee offices. The system enhances operational efficiency, reduces manual errors, and improves user satisfaction by offering a responsive interface and real-time updates.
